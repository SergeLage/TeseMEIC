MONICAP is a monitoring system for the inspection of fishing using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for vessel location and Inmarsat-C technology for satellite communications between ships and a ground control center. MONICAP was successfully introduced on the market by Xsealence and is currently installed or currently being installed on about 800 fishing vessels operating under the control of the authorities of Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and Angola. Within the scope of this Master's thesis, it is proposed to use Portuguese fishing data from the Vessel Monitoring Systems to extract patterns of behavior related to the fishing zones, times, speeds, and directions of the course performed by the ships. The descriptive statistical analysis of these makes it possible to identify patterns of fishing activity, as well as the identification of outliers. The identification of outliers, when performed in real-time, will lead to the consequent generation of alerts. The present study represents the first comprehensive approach to detect and identify the behavior of fishing activities for the main types of equipment based on the tracking of Portuguese fishing fleet data.

The objectives of this work are to identify a solution capable of classifying through the data generated by Monicap if the vessel is fishing and if so, in a new area. Also, create a model capable of classifying the fishing license with the data generated in MONICAP.

For the first problem, we will use a machine learning system to identify whether the vessel is fishing using speed and using clustering algorithms to identify whether the fishing zone is usual or not.
This system will be designed so that it can be integrated into MONICAP itself.
For the second problem, we will use data mining methods to correlate the data provided by MONICAP and the type of fishing license.

The use of velocity turns out to be enough to create systems capable of satisfying the proposed objectives.
The main problem pointed in this work is the lack of VMS data by an authority.
