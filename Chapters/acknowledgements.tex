\acknowledgements

I would first like to thank my thesis supervisor, Professor Iola Maria Silvério Pinto for her support, guidance, and oversight along the writing of this dissertation.

I would like to thank Professor João Carlos Amaro Ferreira and the company Xsealence for providing real VMS data from Portuguese vessels.

I would also like to acknowledge my friend Bruno Miguel Carvalhido Lima from Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto for his greatly appreciated comments and suggestions.

Finally, I cannot pass up the opportunity to thank my family — my wife in
particular —, for her support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this dissertation. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.

Thank you.
