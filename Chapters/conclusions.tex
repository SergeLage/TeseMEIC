\chapter{Analysis of the Ongoing Work}

Looking forward what still need to be done and how the work is progressing there are some aspects that need to be improved.

The major guidelines of the work are defined, the algorithms provide good results classifying images for their pornographic content. There was a major improvement with the SqueezeNet model, although the Resnet still the model with more accuracy. The solution to integrate them with Arquivo.pt Image Search system is also already developed.

More experiments can be performed to try to improve the models, for instance, training the models for more epochs, using more data augmentation, and naturally increasing the dataset.

The main work to be done for the next phase is to improve the report regarding the experiments and solution that has been presented and try improving the model's accuracy with the experiments described above.
